<h1>Cubes of paths are maximally planar</h1>

Here is a puzzle: Draw some points and connect them by lines
to form a path, like the five points on the right connected
by the lines in black.  
<p>
Now connect with further lines, in orange, say, any two
points that are two apart (this is called the "square" of
the path), here points 1 and 3, 2 and 4, 3 and 5,
but <b>so that no two lines intersect</b> (that is, the
resulting graph must be <b>planar</b>).
<p>
The next challenge is to further connect, with red lines,
say, any two points that are three apart (which defines the
"cube" of the path), here points 1 and 4, and 2 and 5.
Again, the lines <b>must not intersect</b>.
This can be done for any number of points.
<p>
<i>Try first on your own to find a solution!</i>
The animation below
shows a solution with two ways to draw the graph.

<p>
The attempt above fails because 1 and 5 can be
connected but do not have to be.
This cannot be right because the cube of a path is
<b>maximally planar</b>, which means that no further points
can be connected with non-intersecting lines.
