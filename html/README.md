# html/ - HTML directory for the GTE webpage

This directory will contain the webpage for GTE as 

./index.html

with JS scripts in ./js/ and subdirectories.

Documentation in .md files.  

The deployment version will have a minified version, with
comments and indentations removed and all .js files in a
single file, which then posted on a suitable directory at
http://www.gametheoryexplorer.org/

The webpage in the current directory with non-minified .js
files should work as well.

## JS modules

Alfonso suggested to use require.js which provides
Asynchronous Module Definition
