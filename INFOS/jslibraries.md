JavaScript is missing stuff (and it's weird)
 For those who don't know: standard JavaScript defines a very
 minimal set of basic library routines or functions. The
 glaringly obvious omission of being able to iterate with a
 forEach led that feature to be reinvented countless
 times...with different syntax.

# backbone.js

http://backbonejs.org/

Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by
 providing models with key-value binding and custom events,
 collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views
 with declarative event handling, and connects it all to
 your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

The project is hosted on GitHub, and the annotated source
 code is available, as well as an online test suite, an
 example application, a list of tutorials and a long list of
 real-world projects that use Backbone.
