Summary of my Google Summer of Code Project during the summer of 2016.

I primarily worked on three features

1. Converting tree games into strategic form games.
Work is present in the branch strategic-form of the jsgte repository (https://github.com/gambitproject/jsgte/tree/strategic-form).

2. Adding undo and redo feature to the tree games.

3. Adding functionality to load an xml tree game and export a game to xml format.

Work on features 2 and three can be found in the undo-redo-load-save branch of the jsgte repository (https://github.com/gambitproject/jsgte/tree/undo-redo-load-save).
