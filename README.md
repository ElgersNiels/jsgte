# jsgte - JavaScript implementation of Game Theory Explorer

html/ contains the files for the JS implementation of GTE

Note: .html files are on their github URL displayed with
their source code, as all code files on github, and NOT as
html pages.

So testing them has to be done separately (locally should be
fine).
